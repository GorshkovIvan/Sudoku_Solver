Task 5.

Sudoku board difficulty is usually determined by the number of
techniques required to solve it. However, my sudoku solver uses trial
and error backtracking algorithm. Therefore, the classic approach is
not applicable and the results of analysis do not necesseraly
represent how a human would determine the difficulty level.

To determine how difficult it is for the algorithm to solve a puzzle,
I applied two methodologies. At first, I have measured the total
number of mistakes my algortim makes while trying to solve a puzzle.

I got the following results:

1) For mystery1: 421488 mistakes
2) For mystery2: 11532 mistakes
3) For mystery3: 14076 mistakes

Secondly, I have measured the total amount of time it takes for the
algorithm to get a solution.

This method produced the following results:

1) For mystery1: 163099 microseconds
2) For mystery2: 4738 microseconds 
3) For mystery3: 5193 microseconds

The execution time was different every time the program was run, but
the difference was found to be negligible.

Mystery2 was found to be unsolvable.

Based on the results above, mystery2 is impossible to solve, mystery3
has a "hard" difficulty level and mystery1 has "extremely hard"
difficulty.
